# Assignment4 VendingMachine
## The VendingMachine - the command line version.

This is the 4:th assignment for the .Net Core C# course.
The Objectives was to learn about Inheritence, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Abstract classes, Testing using xUnit.
I also practiced with Dictionary which was quite new to me.
A class diagram based on UML gives an overview of the classes.

Please take a look at the work, and I hope you can enjoy it!
